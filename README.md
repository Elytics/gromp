## Online Demo

We have removed API call functionality to ensure we do not accidentally expose any data. A live version of this application can be found on the following platform

## League Competition Entry

The following is an entry for the Riot API Challenge 2016, with a focus on Champion Masteries.

This entry goes outside of the regular online league tools (kills, deaths, rankings, ratings), to offer a more fun experience ranging from champion lore, to achievements based on mastery data. We have that the range of tools provided here are fun (achievements), and useful (which chests do I have unlocked?) and are used for some time to come.

This project was built entirely from the ground up, using VueJS and Boostrap.
